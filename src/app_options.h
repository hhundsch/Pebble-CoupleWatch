	//option descriptions:
	//	if START_EVERY_HOUR is selected, the character sends/receives heart every hour at X minutes 
	//		(i.e.: if SENDER_START = 30 then the send animation will fire at 1:30:00, 2:30:00, 3:30:00, etc...)
	//	if START_EVERY_MINUTE is selected, the character sends/receives heart every minute at X seconds 
	//		(i.e.: if RECEIVER_START = 10 then the receive animation will fire at 1:30:10, 1:31:10, 1:32:10, etc...)
	//	if START_EVERY_X_HOURS is selected, the character sends/receives heart every X hours 
	//		(i.e.: if RECEIVER_START = 2 then the receive animation will fire at 2:00:00, 4:00:00, 6:00:00, etc...)
	//	if START_EVERY_X_MINUTES is selected, the character sends/receives heart every X minutes 
	//		(i.e.: if SENDER_START = 5 then the send animation will fire at 2:05:00, 2:10:00, 2:15:00, etc...)
	//	ALTERNATE_WITH_SEND should only be used by the receiver
	//		and if selected, the option used by the sender will be followed by both send and receive animations
	//		the difference is that the send and receive animation will alternate
	//		(i.e.: if SENDER_START_OPTIONS = START_EVERY_X_MINUTES and SENDER_START = 30 then the send animation will fire at 2:30:00, 3:30:00, 4:30:00, while the receive animation will fire at 3:00:00, 4:00:00, 5:00:00, etc...)
	//notes:
	//	if SENDER_START_OPTIONS = ALTERNATE_WITH_SEND then START_EVERY_HOUR will be used instead
	//	if the option START_EVERY_X_HOURS/START_EVERY_X_MINUTES is used and SENDER_START/RECEIVER_START = 0 then SENDER_START/RECEIVER_START will be set to 1 instead 
	//	RECEIVER_START will not be used if RECEIVER_START_OPTIONS = ALTERNATE_WITH_SEND
	//	animations will not be queued 
	//		(i.e.: if a send animation is fired while the receive animation is still going on, the send animation will not be performed after the receive animation is done)
